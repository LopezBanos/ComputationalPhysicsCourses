## Abstract
This is an introductory computational physics course that focus on solving some of the most important numerical physics problems meanwhile teaching the 
important libraries and packages of Python. Furhtermore, in the course some problems are proposed to the stundent and it's easy to find another related
problems to solve by your own by practising the lectures contents.

In this repository you can find all of the course problems with some extra comments and different approach. Lastly, I use to plot in dark-mode because 
for me it's the fanciest and geek way of plotting stuff.

## Series Expansion, Interpolation and Data Fitting

## Derivatives
